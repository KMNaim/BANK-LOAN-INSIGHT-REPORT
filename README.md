# BANK-LOAN-INSIGHT-REPORT
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the Bank Loan Report project. The project aims to monitor and assess a bank's lending activities and performance by creating a comprehensive report that provides insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. This report is essential for making data-driven decisions, tracking the health of the loan portfolio, and identifying trends that inform lending strategies.

Features
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Loan Applications: Calculates the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
Total Funded Amount: Tracks the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM analysis.
Total Amount Received: Monitors the total amount received from borrowers, assessing cash flow and loan repayment with MTD and MoM insights.
Average Interest Rate: Computes the average interest rate across all loans, with MTD and MoM variations to provide insights into the lending portfolio's cost.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluates the average DTI of borrowers, helping to gauge financial health with MTD and MoM fluctuations.
2. Loan Performance Analysis
Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs: Differentiates between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on loan status criteria, including metrics such as loan application percentage, funded amount, and total received amount.
Loan Status Grid View: Offers a comprehensive overview of lending operations by categorizing metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Average Interest Rate' by loan status.
3. Visual Data Representation
The project includes several dashboards that utilize various chart types to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends:

Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Shows how loan applications, funded amounts, and amounts received vary over time.
Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Visualizes lending metrics categorized by state.
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Depicts loan statistics based on different loan terms.
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Illustrates lending metrics distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths.
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Provides a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on loan purposes.
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Displays loan metrics categorized by home ownership statuses.
Terminology
The project utilizes several key data fields and terminologies, including:

Loan ID: A unique identifier for each loan.
Employee Length: The borrowerâ€™s employment stability, indicating job security.
Grade: A risk classification assigned to the loan based on creditworthiness.
Home Ownership: Indicates the borrower's housing status, providing insights into financial stability.
Term: Defines the duration of the loan, impacting repayment periods and interest calculations.
